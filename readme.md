# A - REQUERIMENTS
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   What you need:

   Apache : version 1.3.x or new
   PHP    : version 4.x or new
   MySQL  : version 4.x or new   (maybe 3.x, but not tested)
   Perl   : version 5.8.x or new (maybe 5.6.x, but not tested)
   cjpeg  : As part of jpeg-6b
   OS	  : Unix, Linux  - NOT tested on Windows servers. See "Notes on Windows server".
   Optional gnuplot: 3.7 +

   Notes: 
  
   Be sure to have set on httpd.conf one of this options: "AllowOverride All" or
   "AllowOverride AuthConfig" so Apache can read .htaccess files to restrict access to
   certain folders. Also, you may need to set apache to know that .pl files are CGI
   scripts.  It can be done with "AddHandler cgi-script .pl" on a .htacces file.

   To run Perl scripts you need this modules DBI and DBD::mysql. If you use DBD::mysqlPP
   module you have to change scripts manually to mach this.



# B - INSTALL
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Clone this repository into a temporary place

2. Create a database, a user for that database. Table definitions are in a file called
   "new_tables.sql". Create the tables with a command like: 
    (in example DB=badc user=lucy password=some_passwd)
   There are some more table definifinion on files:
   "votes_tbl.sql"
   "badc_6_HL_slots.sql"

Example how to create databases from shell ($ is shell prompt)

$ mysql --user=root -pYOUR_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD

mysql> create database badc;
mysql> grant all privileges on badc.* to lucy@localhost identified by 'some_passwd' with grant option;
mysql> exit

Now this commands from shell:

$ mysql badc --user=lucy -psome_passwd < new_tables.sql
$ mysql badc --user=lucy -psome_passwd < votes_tbl.sql
$ mysql badc --user=lucy -psome_passwd < badc_6_HL_slots.sql

If you do not have shell access just use some software like phpMyAdmin

   **WARINIG**: any older tables from a running campaing will be droped!! This is to create
   new tables only, for first time, or to reset all to 0. Pilot data, squadrons stats, all
   will be lost if you run this on a running campaign.
   
3. Place files as described in "Notes on Folder organization". Basically just copy all
   files into your webroot folder. Set correct permissions: all .pl must be with exec
   attributes (chmod a+x *.pl) allmost all txt files, log files, and campaing datas need
   to have write attributes. Also write attributes on temporary folders.


4. Edit "config.pl" and "config.php" to match DB name, DB user and DB user password,
   folder paths, program path and other values. There is a description on each value
   inside config.pl file. 

   Edit other mission requeriments, like amount of total human players, amount of players
   per side,  amount of missions per virtual day, dayly AF and city damage recover, damage
   to AF per each pilot killed and for each plane lost, etc...

5. Load index.html and use you browser to check if all works ok. 

   Note!! : Remember to set correct perl path on all .pl files

   Note!! : Make sure scripts are in correct newline format (used dos2unix util if need)
            If you get script error can be because incorrect newlines translations
            errors are "premature end of script headers"

   Register a pilot (you) with same name defined as super_user on config.pl
   Load ref_map.html and run 2 scripts: make attack page, make front.
   
   Later register another pilots, 2 squadrons, go and make some mission, then try to report.

      IMPORTANT: Before you can register a squadron you have to add authcodes into
                 "claves.txt" Read more about this on "Notes on Authcodes".
      IMPORTANT: Be sure to set correct host name on ref1 and ref2 values, if you do not
      set this ok you will get an error on planning a mission " Incorrect HTTP_REFERER"
 
   Once you have all ready and like to start a campaign, you have to restore data files
   (GEO_OBJ and FRONTLINE) because they are changed on all reports.

   Customize your web site. Please do NOT use "Bellum" as campaign name. Bellum is the
   first campaign runnin with this "BADC" (bourne again dinamic campaign). Set you desired
   campaign name, change the rules as you like, customize languages, change sources to
   introduce new fertures, build your style pages, and any customization you like.

   
   IMPORTANT: default pilot registration sets ban_plannig=0, that is you can make
   requests. If you change (default to ban) you will nedd to set plannig rights to some
   pilots, so they can make request. To do that, conect to mysql and run:
      mysql>update bell_pilot_file set ban_planing=0;
   This will give plannig to *all* registered pilots. To give only planing to one pilot do:
      mysql>update bell_pilot_file set ban_planing=0 where hlname="PILOT_NAME";


   When a map is over, go to config.pl, change config to use a new map, the go to
   ref_map.html and run all 3 scripts to make map, front and suply images.

   In the DOCS folder you have a dump of FAQ and manual add ons from bellum forum.
   understanting on how campaing works will help understand the code too.

   The MAP_DATAS folder contains original data files. In case you like to restart a map,
   here they are. Some of Those data files when are placed on CGI-BIN folder are changed
   as campaigns run.

# C- NOTES
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1) Notes on Windows server
 
   I really dont know if it can work or not. I made only a few test using Windows XP SP2 +
   IndigoPerl +MySQL. Scripts works ok. But i didnt strong tested all programs. The only
   modification needed is the path to perl on the first line of ALL .pl files:

       If perl is on your path this will work:
           #!perl
       If not, place complete path to perl:
          #!C:\path_to_perl\perl

	  I can't say if there is a
   gnuplot version for windows, and havent tested image convertions using cjpeg.exe

You can get Mysql for windows here: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

Perl for windows https://www.perl.org/get.html

cjpeg for windows aviable here : http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/jpeg.htm
gnuplot for windows: http://www.gnuplot.info/

config.pl looks different for windows server because windows uses backslash as folder
limiters, so an extra backslash is need to escape. Make sure paths do NOT contains spaces.
If they do, you have to add escaped quotes. Take a look into config_windows.pl examples.

2) Notes on Folder organization and Files description.

 There are some folder that are mandatory, becasue there is no option on config to
 change them. It is possible to do but you have to manually change all script and php
 files, or better, set them as variables and later place them on config.* files
 The mandatory folders layout are:

Home                      
\---public_html          Web root (html, php, css and other files)
    |---gen              generated data files (control files, mis, properties)
    |---images           general images dir
    |---rep              html reports, reported missions zip files and eventlogs
    \---tmp              temporary place for mission download

Aditionally you can set up custom place for:
cgi-bin folder   :    to hold scripts and campaing datafiles
a temp folder    :    for mission upload and some other cgi temporary data (plot[123].pl) uses a temp folder.
data-backup folder :    to hold backup data

This is the layout i use:

Home                      
\---public_html          Web root (html, php and other files)
    |---cgi-bin          CgiExec dir (most perl and data files)
    |   |---data_bkup    backups for data before reporting a mission
    |   \---tmp          temp dir for cgi plots data files and upload missions
    |---gen              generated data files (control files, mis, properties)
    |---images           general images dir
    |---rep              html reports, reported missins zip files and eventlogs
    \---tmp              temporary place for mission download

Another layout:

Home                      
|---public_html          Web root (html, php and other files)
|   |---gen              generated data files (control files, mis, properties)
|   |---images           general images dir
|   |---rep              html reports, reported missins zip files and eventlogs
|   \---tmp              temporary place for mission download
|
\---cgi-bin              CgiExec dir (most perl and data files)
    |---data_bkup        bakups for data before reporting a mission
    \---tmp              temp dir for cgi plots data files

3) Notes on Logfiles

There are several log files, 3 are the more important:
- Gen_log.txt is the generator logfile. 
- Par_log.txt is the parser logfile.
- Pilot_log.txt is the logfile that holds all registration, pilot deletion, and other
  pilot/sqds actions.

Other logs are:
clima_control.txt:  logfile with weather setup after a reported mission
used_claves.txt: logfile of all used authcodes
warn.txt: logfile with all parser warning, visible from website.
options.txt: holds all mission requests, not sorted
used_options.txt: holds all combination of request to build a mission.


4)Notes about lockfiles.

Default locks are _gen.lock and _par.lock
If this files appears, check logfiles. check is there is a corrupt mission report (html,Mysql)
after detecting what was problem, (fix html, fix mysql, etc) remove files.
Used also to lock programs on special cases, updating data, server problem, etc. Just
manualy create those files in cgi-bin folder.


5)Notes about counters and datafiles.

mis_counter.data : holds mission number, format is underscore plus 5 digits. ex  _000001
rep_counter.data : holds report number, format is underscore plus 5 digits. ex  _000001

6) Notes on Authcodes

Authcodes are there to avoid massive squad registration. If you force to get an auth code,
the interested has to register in forum. Many times people gets tired on register in a new
forum, and they do not participate because that, so, at least the commander of squadrons
knows where is the forum, it will be registered on forum , and this helps on participation
and get involved.

Valid authcodes are just a list on a file (claves.txt). When someone uses a code, it is
printed into another file (used_claves.txt) with all used authcodes. So validation script
will look first into claves.txt for a valid code and if it is found it will look on
used_claves.txt file to check if it was used. Since the claves.txt holds many authcodes,
someone can try to gess one, recomended auth codes are words not in dictionary

If you want to disable this, you can edit script to avoid verification, or you can leave a
single valid code, but stop writing it to used_claves.txt. This way you have a unique code
(or many) that can be reused.

7) Notes on mission creation.

Mission creation starts on create.php by taking a host slot, then both sides takes request
slots, making each requests. Each request can be done, because take_slot.pl will display
maps, targets, plane and plane counters to fill. This information is readed from several
places:

-Selectable planes (human and AI) are listed on config.pl on every map change you have to
set new list.
-Selectable target places are readed from "Options_R.txt" and "Options_B.txt". This 2 files
are built by parser afer a report. Every time a mission is reported, map front line can
change, so targets can be or not avaliable. Parser make correct selections based on rules in
code.
-Status data (damage on city, airfields and other info) is readed from a file
"Status.txt", and like before, this file is created by parser. This file holds information
common for both sides.

This way each side can see a page to select planes, targets and plane numbers. once the
request is submited, data is inserted into database (host_slots_tbl) and specific flight
data and target is dumped into options.txt

Once both request are done host hits download link: Now generator will search in database
(host_slots_tbl) the names and other information. The specific targets and aircraft options
are readed from the file "options.txt", if all goes ok, both options are dumped into
"used_options.txt" mission is created using the number of mission from "mis_counter.data"
host_slots_tbl are cleared, mission is copied to a temporary folder password protected.

The very first question is why i use database to hold some information, and "options.txt"
to hold more specific data. Why not use only database?  The answer is because in first
stages, of development there was not a mission creation page like is now. We have just
options dumped into a file and the creation page was a simple html reading options from
"options.txt" file, and not listed on "used_options.txt". When i was developing new creation
system i focus on things like army side, a nice grafic interface, host rights, planning
rights and so on. But i never integrated all the request information on database, so i
just keep using old system with this 2 files. For sure, will be much better to include all
data into host_slots_tbl DB and forget about those 2 files.

8) Notes on images.  

All images i provide are made by me, or generous made by member comunity help on
development. Some images are used with permission and other images not made by me are
modifications of images made by other people i used as starting point, then changing shape,
brightness, details, aditions deletions. A couple of images are buttons, used to link to
other places, like Hyperlobby website and W3C validator. The emoticons i use on report
comments in bellum campaing are free avaliable to USE (not distribute) from web wiz forums.
please read "Notes on Emoticons".

Warning on Historical Markings:

I have to say that squadrons uses to easy identify which side they fly a medal image. A
Soviet star for Soviet Air force and a German medal with a Historical Markings for German air
forces. Also, there is a soviet flag and a german flag displayed close to every name on
stats, to easy know whisc side a pilot fly. Those images are historic. There is no
conection with racism or political reasons. However i make that german images are NOT
displayed by default. To see those images, user have to click on link "allow german
images" this will set a cookie and images will be displayed. You later can click on
"disallow german images" to valid them, or just delete cookies. Because default action is
not to display them.

9) Notes on javascript

I use javascript on several places. Most of cases simple checks. But 2 cases need mention:

On takeslot.pl the plane selector form is based on a script original by Vladimir Geshanov
called "form select 2D". My code is a strong modification of that
one, and selection is done by regular expression. I can easy remove his credits by
rewriting shared lines, but i prefer to mention his original work. Because that his name
and website is printed on every form using this scripts. Nothing to hide. If you plan to
remove his credit, please rewrite all selectPlane() function. That will be fair. 

Reports has a "Popup information box II" on prints link, so placing the mouse over you get
a list of all events points related to reach that score. Script is Taked from
http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex5/dhtmltooltip.htm, that is free for use if you
keep original copyright notice (like i do). But it can NOT be distributed, so i have to
take out from parser. Also im not writing a replacement, so if you like to have the same
tool tip just go to dynamicdrive and het any tooltip you like, then change parser to
generate reports using the javascript of your preference.
You can find the place on parser (badc_par_1.pl) where the script was located and called:
## REMOVED JAVASCRIPT TOOLTIP STYLE
## REMOVED JAVASCRIPT TOOLTIP CODE
And how it was called: 
#Points description used with JAVASCRIPT TOOLTIP  (if use comment pev line)
 

# D- CREDITS
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


OK, Lets go in order: :)

First thanks is for Maddox Games for this exelent sim, no second to any other WW2
sim. Bellum campaign is possible because IL2-FB exelent design, making mission files easy
to build (just formated text) and mission results very detailled in text format. This 2
simple things, maybe not important for many other sim programmers, make a wrold of
difference. http://www.il2sturmovik.com 

Second I will thanks to all makers of online wars previous to bellum. I start to play
several online wars and after that,  based on what those projects offers and what they lack
bellum become an idea to offer the best of online wars plus new unique feratures. I cant
say bellum archived that, but what we have in belllum proved not to be so bad. Special
thanks for Starshow (VEF1 and VEF2 maker), and to VOW team. I realy know how much time and
efforts are need to make those projects

I have to mention Jiri Fojtasek for his great online lobby. He is creator of HyperLobby,
where our campaing runs.  http://hyperfighter.jinak.cz

Special thanks to Pirx (88.IAP_Pirx pirx@88-iap.de) for allow use his plane table. All his
work on colection historic planes usage is exelent. http://www.yogysoft.de/

Now is time to thanks III/JG52_Meyer, for so many conversations we have speaking about new
feartures for bellum. Many of the base options we have in bellum are there because he pointed
to me. With those ideas bellum started as a project and become public on SG1 squadron
forums. Here i got the suport needed on SG1_Gunkan to this project keep moving. You know,
he saw the light.

After that, Bellum was developed in spanish comunity, and here a very important work was
done by several squadrons, helping me to find bugs, to make new options, making
sugestions, flying testing and so on. This squadrons i like to say thanks are (in
alphabetic order): AA, AH, CN, E111, ECV56, ESA, FAE, FK1, HR, III/JG52, RedEye, SG1 and
StG_111. Some of them with more participation, but at end, all help to develop.

Several persons help me a lot in particular problems and work (web site, templates, and
other things): AH_Jacketon, HR_Ootoito, HR_Barripower, StG111_Darth_Rye, FK1_Sturmbomber,
FAE_Almogavar, SG1_Cantos, III/JG52_Orka, FAE_Coyote. Later, when bellum was on final beta
i got help from not spanish player: RR_OldMan, RC_Shtirlitz, ET=Mitya, LLv26_Mikko,
LeOs.K_Anak, just to mention by memory. I really apreciate all help for this guys and
forgive me if i missed some names, im sure list is incomplete because i got help from many
other people.

I have to mention Junior (Luftwaffe 39-45) for give us permission to use images form his
great website

Finally, i apreciate all people flying campaign day by day. thats all

Aditional NOTES

How to apply these terms to Your new programs.

Case 1) You use this software as is, without modifications. Nothing has to be done, just
agree with this license.

Case 2) You change sources, customize them, improve them, make bug fixes:

    * 2.a) You keep your changes with exactly same Non-copileft licence: Replace
        "JG10r_Dutertre" with your name or company name on above licence and replace
        software name and version to the name you like different to "BADC 1.0".

    * 2.b) You like to make your changes meet GNU licence: Usually this means you will add
        the GNU licence (copyleft), and this avoid futher usage on binay only
